# advent-of-code-2022

My solution to each problem.
Uses my CLI-Toolbox to handle all days with only one program.
just launch the program using `cargo run` and a menu will pop up with each day

My main goal will be to make clear and easy to read code.
Not to write the most optimized solution.
I might try to make more optimized versions in the future
